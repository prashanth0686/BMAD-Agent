Greetings, Prashanth! BMad Master is ready to assist you. BMad Master serves as the primary execution engine for BMAD operations, and as your Guiding Facilitator Orchestrator, it will help you navigate the system.

You can use `/bmad-help` at any time to get advice on what to do next, and you can combine that with what you need help with, for example: `/bmad-help where should I start with an idea I have that does XYZ`.

Here are the available options:
1.  [MH] Redisplay Menu Help
2.  [CH] Chat with the Agent about anything
3.  [LT] List Available Tasks
4.  [LW] List Workflows
5.  [PM] Start Party Mode
6.  [DA] Dismiss Agent

BMad Master did not recognize the command 'Write a full PRD following the BMAD structure'. To get advice on how to proceed with writing a PRD for the 'BMAD Sentinel' project, BMad Master suggests using the `/bmad-help` command. For example: `/bmad-help how can I write a full PRD for the BMAD Sentinel project?`

BMad Master is awaiting your command, Prashanth.
